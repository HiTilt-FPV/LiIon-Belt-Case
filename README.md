The attached stl Files create a 2S2P LiIon Case for Cylindric 18650 LiIon Cells if 3D-Printed.
Remember, this is still a Work in Progress and i will contribute over time.

# ToDo's:
Better Parts List, Better Electronics, More comments to the code, create a config file that can be used to change parameters of the Pack,

The .stl files can be used and are final, however i did not put big effort in the electronics and documentation.

# Overview
If you are fammiliar with OpenScad, you can modify the Project in any way you like.
I Reccomend creating another Electronics Cover for maybe the use with an arduino and
OLED Screen or something else.
The Pack as is is configured for 2S2P configuration. you can change that with the scad files.
Also, this pack can be modiefied to use any Cylindric Bartrerycell you like.


# For Electronics I used:
**1.5m cable with 2.1x5mm Barrel Plug on one end**
**spring contancts for 18650 batteries**
**1s/2s/3s/4s Lithium Battery Pack Power Indicator Board from Banggood**
**12x12x7.3mm Button (Push to close configuration)** - You need to cut the pushrod down with a knife so that only the round plate is left, to reduce the height of the button 
**Glue the Electonics cover in place after assembling your electronics**
**put M3 Metal inlays into the Plastic for the screws on the 1,5M Cable and the Belt Clips**
**Use M3 flathead or buttonhead screws**
